# Regex Tutorial

As a web developer, I have developed this tutorial to help explain the intricacies of regular expressions (regex). By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand and construct regex patterns for a variety of uses in programming.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will break down the components of a regex pattern used to match HTML tags. For example, the regex pattern `/<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)/` is used to match standard and self-closing HTML tags. We will dissect this pattern piece by piece to understand how it works.
