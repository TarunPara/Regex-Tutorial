# Understanding Regular Expressions in JavaScript

Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation of strings in JavaScript. In this tutorial, we'll explore various components of regular expressions and their functionalities within the context of JavaScript.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the intricacies of regular expressions in JavaScript. We'll cover the fundamental components such as anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matching, boundaries, back-references, as well as look-ahead and look-behind assertions. We'll provide explanations and examples for each component to help you understand their usage.

```javascript
// Example regex used throughout the tutorial
const regex = /pattern/;

Regex Components

Anchors
Anchors are symbols that assert a position before, after, or between characters. Common anchors include ^ for the start of a string and $ for the end of a string.

Example: ^pattern

Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group in a regex pattern. They include * for zero or more occurrences, + for one or more occurrences, ? for zero or one occurrence, and {} for specifying a specific range.

Example: a+

OR Operator
The OR operator, denoted by |, matches either the pattern preceding it or the pattern following it.

Example: pattern1|pattern2

Character Classes
Character classes allow matching any character from a set. They are denoted by square brackets [].

Example: [aeiou]

Flags
Flags modify the behavior of a regex pattern. Common flags include g for global search, i for case-insensitive search, and m for multiline search.

Example: /pattern/g

Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are used for grouping and capturing parts of a regex pattern. They allow extracting matched substrings.

Example: (pattern)

Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions match any one of the enclosed characters. They are similar to character classes but offer more flexibility.

Example: [a-zA-Z]

Greedy and Lazy Match
Quantifiers are greedy by default, meaning they match as much as possible. Adding ? after a quantifier makes it lazy, matching as little as possible.

Example: .*?

Boundaries
Boundaries assert the position of a match relative to word boundaries or non-word boundaries.

Example: \bword\b

Back-references
Back-references allow referring to previously captured groups within a regex pattern.

Example: (pattern)\1

Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are used to ensure that a pattern is or is not followed or preceded by another pattern, without including it in the match.

Example: (?=pattern)
